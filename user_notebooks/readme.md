# TRAM 2 User Notebooks

This directory contains four notebooks that allow one to use the SciBERT models developed during the 2023 TRAM effort.
The models will run prohibitively slowly without a GPU, so if you do not have a computer with a GPU available,
we advise uploading the notebooks to Google Colab to take advantage of their free GPU resources.

These links will open the notebooks directly in Google Colab.
